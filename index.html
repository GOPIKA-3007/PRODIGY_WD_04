                        <p>HI GUYS! I'm an Artist, Dancer and a ComputerScience Engineering Student.
                           Most of my painting works are based on landscape,still life objects etc...
                           In the case of dancing, I majored in bharatanatyam and a little bit of mohiniyattam.
                           My aim as a computer science engineer is to pioneer technology improvements that directly address significant global concerns. 
                           I want to use my computer science abilities to provide innovative solutions to real-world challenges in healthcare, environmental protection, and education. 
                           I believe in the power of cooperation, and I value varied viewpoints and teamwork in order to develop effective solutions. 
                           Continuous learning is essential; I'm devoted to remaining up to date on the latest trends and technology, and I'm embarking on a lifelong learning adventure.
